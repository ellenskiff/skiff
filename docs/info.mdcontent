Born in '92, raised in the Midwest, and hard at work ever since.

Ellen Skiff is a multidisciplinary Graphic Designer in Portland, Oregon. She works with brands to help build their graphic library and convey distinct and meaningful messages. Her expertise include **logo design**, **branding**, **graphic experimentation**, **workflows**, and **typography**. When not computing she's usually riding around to local digs on her bike, planning a camping trip, or working on expanding that circle we call "the comfort zone".

She loves to get coffee. 

She hates writing in the third person.
